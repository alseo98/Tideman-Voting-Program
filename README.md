# Tideman-Voting-Program
A program  tideman.c)  that takes a limit of 9 candidates to simulate an election. It does so more accurately than just "plurality" voting by first, tallying all the votes into an array and then finding out by how many votes they are preferred over other candidates. Then, using a sorting algorithm the preferences of each pair is ranked by decreasing order of strength of victory. Then by using the idea of sources and nodes with arrows pointing to signify which candidate is preferred over the other, we can look at the source of the graph and conclude that the winner is the candidate with no arrows pointing to him/her.
